	    <p>I am not a regular donor. But with switch over of job which makes me travel every day a minimum of 40 to 50 kms within the city made me realise the value of human beings every day struggle with life, ill health etc. I realised how we healthy men and women never think of blood donation.<br>
		But now I have become a regular donor and after giving blood I never felt ill or went to a doctor with any complaint. </p>

	    <h4>Anil Reddy - </h4>
	    <p>I brought awareness of blood donation among my friends and made two others regular donors and they felt very happy participating in social activities. I think more publicity is required in rural areas to bring awareness among the donors.<br>
		My experience has been Nice.</p>

	    <h4>B S Narahari - </h4>
	    <p>I started donating blood while I was studying. My teacher Smt. Renukamba was the source of encouragement. A Rotary blood camp was organised in our campus. I went there out of curiosity. Many refused to donate but my teacher did'nt. That inspired me and it also became my first blood donation. Since then I have donated at least 8 times which is at least twice a year.<br>
		I am healthy. Don't get worried after or before donating. You are saving a life with your blood </p>

	    <p>I have donated blood many times. Once Idonated blood to a person at a government hospital. The person who needed blood had many relatives around who were not ready to donate blood. In fact, they were not aware of blood donation which is not a very good sign. </p>
